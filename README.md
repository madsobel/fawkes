# Fawkes
Fawkes is a utility app built for developers and other technical persons who appreciates having a swiss army knife at their disposal at all times.

This project was originally built to be an Electron app, but since I did not want to bother with distribution and licensing, I have ported it to a Next.js app and made it 100% and open source. 

I was pretty fed up with having to go to random websites to do trivial developer stuff, and the existing apps offering a solution for this were either too expensive for my taste or simply not good enough.

## Fawkes?
Fawkes is Dumbledores phoenix from Harry Potter, first appearing in "The Chamber of Secrets" aiding Harry Potter to defeat Voldemort in the shape of a memory. Fawkes come to aid when help is the most needed. This app hope fully does the same.
